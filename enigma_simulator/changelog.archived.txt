Electronic Enigma Machine Changelog
===================================

Version 0.5.0 26th Jun 2018 [STABLE]
* [ADD] Implemented reflector factory to allow reading of reflector(s) from an
  XML file.
* [ADD] Added reflector xml file for wide reflectors B and C.
* [MOD] Removed hard-coded reflector in the EngimaMachine class constructor and
  it is now passed in correctly.
* [MOD] Updated EnigmaMachine unit tests after change so reflectors are passed
  in by constructor.
* [ADD] Implemented the plugboard.
* [ADD] Implemented unit tests for the plugboard.
* [ADD] Implemented unit tests for the reflector factory.
* [MOD] Added the missing unit test function headers to UnitTest_RotorFactory.
* [MOD] Updated EnigmaMachine to use a plugboard.
Unit Test Coverage:
- EnigmaMachine    100% coverage.
- MachineSetup     100% coverage.
- Plugboard        100% coverage
- Reflector        100% coverage.
- ReflectorFactory 100% coverage.
- Rotor            100% coverage.
- RotorContact     100% coverage.
- RotorFactory     100% coverage.


Version 0.4.1 19th Jun 2018 [STABLE]
* [ADD] Added unit tests for:
        - Rotor         100% coverage.
        - RotorContact  100% coverage.
        - Plugboard     100% coverage (although plugboard not implemented).
        - EnigmaMachine  98% coverage (Remaining are plugboard stubs).
        - MachineSetup  100% coverage.
        - Reflector     100% coverage.
        - RotorFactory  100% coverage.
* [DEL] Removed CommonDefs as duplicate code.
* [ADD] Created overarching python script for test coverage.


Version 0.4.0 14th Jun 2018
* [ADD] Added function SetRotorPosition to EnigmaMachine class to allows rotor
  positions to be set.
* [MOD] Changed how trace route works to make it a tidier.
* [ADD] Added property for rotor offset.
* [MOD] Renamed Rotor::GetCircuit to GetForwardCircuit so that it matches the
  reverse one.  In the process removed CircuitDirection enumeration as it is no
  longer required.
* [MOD] Refactored Rotor class to fix issues
* [MOD] Updated copyright for 2018
* [MOD] General code update to replace tabs with spaces and generally conform
        more to PEP 8.
* [ADD] Created RotorContact class that contains rotor contact information and
        has functionality to covert a contact into a character and vice versa.
* [MOD] Moved test machine into Sourcecode directory.
  Still to be done:
  - Loading reflectors from XML file.
  - Cleaner method of setting rotor positions.
  - Rotor offsetting (Ringstellung).
  - Port unit tests from C++ to Python.
  - Implement plugboard.
  - Visual front end.


Version 0.3.0 22nd Feb 2017
* Initial version of the rewritten Enigma machine, now written in Python.
  Currently implemented:
  - Rotor stepping & rotor double stepping.
  - Loading rotors from an XML file and selecting which ones to use.
  - Reflector
  Still to be done:
  - Loading reflectors from XML file.
  - Cleaner method of setting rotor positions.
  - Rotor offsetting (Ringstellung).
  - Porting of unit tests from C++ to Python.


Version 0.2.0 27th Mar 2016
* [MOD] Removed m_startPositions from EngimaMachine class as it doesn't serve
  any useful purpose.
* [MOD] Renamed Types::ContactsWiring to Types::RotorWiring.
* [ADD] Added static data for wide reflectors B & C.
* [ADD] Added static data for passthrough setup of plugboard.
* [MOD] Replaced iRotor::GetOuterContact() and iRotor::GetInnerContact() with
  iRotor::Encode().
* [NEW] Added additional unit tests for EnigmaMachine:
  - Single letter encoding
  - Testing rotors in encoding.
  - Testing reflector in encoding. 


Version 0.1.0 14th Sep 2015
* Initial version which is core only, this only support Enigma 1 and doesn't
  include any form of rotor stepping code.

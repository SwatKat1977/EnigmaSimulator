# EnigmaSimulator

A software simulator of the World War II German Enigma encryption machine.

The simulator will eventually allow different models of the machine to be configured with various rotors or reflectors.  The initial version will concentrate on the Enigma 1 model.

The project is designed to be educational and released in the hope it will be useful and entertaining.

# EnigmaSimulator

A software simulator of the famous German Enigma encryption machine used during World War II.

The simulator will eventually allow different models of the machine to be configured with various rotors or reflectors.  The initial version will concentrate on the Enigma 1 model.

The project is designed to be educational and released in the hope it will be useful and entertaining.

## Project Status
The code base has been moved from it's original hosting to Github.  The original simulator was written in Python 2.7, this is currently getting updated to Python 3.8, along with an extensive code factoring (see development branch).
